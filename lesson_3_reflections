When other Teammembers make changes i do not want to have in my repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Branches are working on the code, without changing the master-files and are good to make some extensions.
Clones copy an existing Repository on your computer and set the origin-remote to the repositories' URL.
Forks are a clone, which operates on Git-Hub and makes you able to copy some code and make an own repository without having
    to clone and make an own repo afterwards. The original auther can see your version as well.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can work on a stable version without being disrupted by changes, which affect your current work.
